* Project Organization

To manage complexity, adopt a modular design by splitting the calculator into distinct components. This approach makes development, testing, and debugging easier, especially in assembly where code can quickly become hard to follow.

** File Structure

Organize your project with separate assembly files for each major task:
main.asm: The entry point and main program logic that ties everything together.

*** input.asm: Handles reading user input from the console.

*** parser.asm: Parses the input string into numbers and operators.

*** calc.asm: Performs the arithmetic and advanced calculations.

*** output.asm: Displays the results to the console.

* Setting Tasks and Goals

Since a calculator can get complicated, start small and build incrementally. Here’s a roadmap with clear milestones:

** Milestones

*** Basic Integer Calculator

Goal: Handle integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Tasks:

Write code to read integer input from the console using Linux system calls (read).

Parse simple expressions like 5 + 3.

Perform calculations using integer arithmetic instructions.

Output the result using write.

Why: Establishes the core structure without the complexity of floating-point or advanced parsing.

*** Floating-Point Support

Goal: Extend the calculator to handle decimal numbers.

Tasks:

Use x87 FPU or SSE instructions for floating-point operations.

Update parsing to recognize decimal points (e.g., 3.14 + 2.5).

Test basic operations with floating-point numbers.
Why: Introduces floating-point handling, a key CPU feature.

*** Exponentiation

Goal: Add support for exponential functions (e.g., 2 ^ 3).

Tasks:

Implement exponentiation using FPU instructions or iterative multiplication.

Update parser to recognize ^ or similar notation.

Why: Builds on floating-point skills with a moderately complex operation.

*** Logarithms
Goal: Implement logarithmic functions (e.g., log 100).

Tasks:

Research logarithmic algorithms (e.g., natural log via series expansion).

Add to calc.asm using FPU instructions.

Extend parser for log keyword or symbol.

Why: Challenges your understanding of mathematical approximations in assembly.

*** Trigonometric Functions

Goal: Add sine, cosine, etc. (e.g., sin 1.57).

Tasks:

Use FPU instructions (fsin, fcos) or implement Taylor series.

Parse trig function calls (e.g., sin, cos).
Why: Explores advanced FPU usage and precision handling.

*** Precision and Error Handling

Goal: Ensure accurate results and handle edge cases.

Tasks:

Test rounding modes and precision with FPU control words.

Add error handling for division by zero, invalid input, etc.

Display error messages via output.asm.
Why: Tackles real-world challenges of floating-point arithmetic.

*** Tips for Success

Start Simple: Get integer addition working before moving to division or floating-point.

Test Incrementally: Verify each module (input, parsing, calculation) as you go.

Use Comments: Assembly is low-level—comment heavily to track what each line does.

Handling Parsing and Precision

Parsing Expressions

Parsing is tricky in assembly because you’re working with raw strings (e.g., "3.14 + 2"). Here’s a basic approach:

Simple Parser: 

Read input as a string using the read system call.

Scan the string character by character to identify numbers and operators.

Convert number strings (e.g., "3.14") to binary using a routine (e.g., process digits and decimal point separately).

Use a stack or state machine to evaluate expressions like 3 + 4 * 2.

Learning: Study recursive descent parsing or postfix notation (e.g., Reverse Polish Notation) in a higher-level language first, then adapt to assembly.

Precision Issues

Floating-Point: Use the x87 FPU for extended precision (80-bit floats) or SSE for standard precision (32/64-bit). Learn FPU instructions like fld, fadd, fdiv.

Rounding: Set FPU rounding modes via the control word to control precision.

Challenges: Trig and log functions may need approximations (e.g., Taylor series), which can introduce errors—test thoroughly.

Projects and Resources to Study

Projects to Explore

Simple Assembly Programs
Look for x86-64 examples that read input and print output (e.g., echo programs). Check GitHub or assembly tutorials.

Example: A program that reads a number and doubles it—adapt this for calculator input/output.

Basic Calculators in Assembly
Search for open-source x86 assembly calculators. Even simple ones (e.g., integer-only) show structure and system call usage.

Example: NASM tutorials often include small arithmetic programs.

Expression Parsers in Higher-Level Languages

Study C or Python calculator implementations (e.g., a command-line calculator on GitHub). Focus on their parsing logic, then translate to assembly.

Why: Gives you a blueprint for parsing and evaluation.

Math Libraries

Examine how glibc or other libraries implement sin, log, etc. (source available online). You won’t use them directly but can mimic their algorithms.
